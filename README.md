The PLU Clubs App aims to create a better experience for PLU students to conveniently access all PLU Clubs. 
Inspired by the social media of today, this Android mobile application and server will act as a communication hub that connects clubsâ€™ members and boards efficiently. 
Users will be able to view, join, and create clubs and activities. The application also has the ability to recommend clubs to the user based on responses to an in-app interest survey. 
Following REST API and Android MVVM architecture, we have created a communication hub with ease of access and centralized information.
